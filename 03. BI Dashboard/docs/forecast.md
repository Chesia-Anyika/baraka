## Forecast and Trend Analysis Dashboard

The Forecast and Trend Analysis Dashboard is user-friendly page designed to help users predict future sales and analyze historical trends. Built with Streamlit, this dashboard offers a seamless and interactive experience for performing predictive analysis and visualizing complex data relationships. The interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to easily specify forecast parameters, choose predictive algorithms, and interpret data correlations.

In the sidebar, users can customize their analysis by specifying the number of months for the forecast, selecting the forecast variable (such as sales), and choosing from various predictive algorithms. This customization enables users to tailor the analysis to their specific needs and ensures that the forecasts are relevant to their particular business context.

The main area of the dashboard is rich with detailed visualizations. At the top right, the "Sales Forecast using Simple Exponential Smoothing" chart displays historical sales data alongside forecasted values. This chart is crucial for users to see expected future sales trends based on their chosen forecasting algorithm. The juxtaposition of historical and forecasted data allows for a clear comparison, helping to highlight potential future sales patterns and deviations from historical trends.

To the bottom left, the "Correlation Matrix" provides a heatmap that shows the correlations between different financial variables such as cost, profit, and sales. This matrix is an essential tool for identifying the strength and direction of relationships between these variables. Understanding these correlations helps users infer how changes in one variable might impact others, facilitating more informed decision-making.

The "Financial Decomposition Analysis" chart, located at the bottom right, breaks down sales data into its trend and seasonal components. This decomposition is particularly useful for distinguishing between underlying trends and seasonal effects in the sales data. By separating these components, users can gain a deeper understanding of the factors driving their sales performance over time, which is critical for strategic planning and resource allocation.

Additionally, the dashboard includes a "Correlogram" that provides an autocorrelation plot for the selected forecast variable. This plot, found in the secondary view, shows the correlation of the variable with itself at different time lags. It helps users understand the persistence of trends over time and the potential influence of past values on future outcomes, which is important for refining predictive models.
